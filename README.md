# golang-todolist-blog-example

Just a repository used as an example for a blog post I'm writing. Also using it to try and find my Go project structure style. 
Lots of inspiration taken from [https://github.com/katzien/go-structure-examples](https://github.com/katzien/go-structure-examples).

Basically a todolist server to create, list and complete tasks.

## How to run?

```bash
go run -v ./cmd/server
```
